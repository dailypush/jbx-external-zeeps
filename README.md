IMPORTANT: Create a Browser / BrowserSource in your streaming software with the URL: `http://localhost:1284/`

ENSURE that the Browser SIZE is EXACTLY **1280x115**, but you can then move and scale it to fit your setup width after setting this.

The browser will appear empty aside from an initial bar that may slide up, but the bar will come down during challenges.

Note that the bar will persist if you exit or close the game in the middle of a challenge, but will fix itself if players start joining again. (I'll fix this soon)
